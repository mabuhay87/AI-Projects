##  About
This repository documents my continuous learning and practical development journey as I train in:
-  Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
-  Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, LSTMs)
-  Artificial Intelligence (NLP, Reinforcement Learning, and Intelligent Systems)

Each project includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Well-documented Python code
- Datasets or data links
- Summaries and visualizations
