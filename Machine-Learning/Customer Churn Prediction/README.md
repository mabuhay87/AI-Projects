# Customer Churn Prediction (Telco)

This project builds a complete **machine learning pipeline** to predict customer churn for a telecom company using a Telco-style synthetic dataset.

## Project Overview

- Predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service)
- Identify key drivers of churn using SHAP explainability
- Export churn predictions for use in a **Power BI dashboard**
- Save trained models for deployment or reuse

## Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- XGBoost
- SHAP (model explainability)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
- Power BI (for dashboarding, using exported CSVs)

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone or Download

Clone this repo or download the ZIP and extract it.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Open `notebooks/churn_model.ipynb` in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab, and execute the cells from top to bottom.

The notebook will:

- Train three ML models
- Evaluate performance
- Generate SHAP explanations
- Export predictions for Power BI
- Save trained models as `.pkl` files

### 4. Build Power BI Dashboard

Use `data/churn_predictions.csv` (and optionally `data/telco_churn_full.csv`) in Power BI to build:

- Churn rate by RiskLevel
- Churn by Contract type
- Churn by Tenure bands
- High-risk customer tables

## Notes

- The dataset here (`telco_churn_full.csv`) is a **synthetic Telco-style dataset** created for learning and portfolio purposes.
- You can swap in the official Kaggle Telco Churn dataset if desired by adjusting the column names and rerunning the notebook.
